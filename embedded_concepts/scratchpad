Hi Myself, Rajkumar Patel. I hold 7+ years of firmware and embedded software development activity throught my career. 
Media storage, Cloud storage, Network storage and IoT are some of the areas I have worked in.
Which also includes writing baremetal firmware, RTOS based application and building IoT Gateway SDK and hands-on with complete product development lifecycle, with Agile methodologies.
My main programming language has been C and for close to one year also used python.
CPP is something I have been using for developing tests for our software products for a long period.
I am seeing my learning in embedded systems domain, working on and implementing core domain of linux kernel and would like to get hang of device driver development in coming years.

my preparation for coming days.


brushing up past experience.

2. what are the use case of the product? 
	- in which environment prodcuts can be used?

QnA
- general guidelines of using controller
	-- if VR headset -- HPF qualcomm [read about pixer because, that's where they want us to hire for], multicore, low power, low cost, high performance, hight speed, OS Support (what kind of responsiveness we want here? these kind of questions comes for OS selection), there are cirteria. [know which platforms are popular with therse matrix items and how why they are leading that segment?]
	-- if you don't know matrix make faire asumptions.
	-- knowing application speicific which platforms to be used / controller to be used, ask to AI.
	-- ask about google AI prodcuts, nest, pixer, etc.

-- levarage from the background



-- what makes something priviledge and something unpriviledge?
MPU makes region or partition of memory region.
and it marks each region with several attributes, like priviledge leveles, kind of accesses properties, sharable or not, ordering, type of device of device, write through, or writeback is it or not [port access, if it's input or output], etc.

types of memory can be. 
normal memory (data + code)
device memory (IO peripheral, memory mapped io)
system memory (NVIC regiseter, MPU register, sys tick registers)

ARM has 2 modes of operations
priviledged -- access to all. e.g. syste control memory, OS programming clock, memory mapping, interrupt vector table, reset handler.
unpriviledged -- restricted for devices and system memory, other unpriviledged code/task.
SO each code/instrcution in particular region has priviledge mapped and based on that access of memory can be done.

PSR and PCR has priviledge bit.
MSR, MRS instruction are used to set priviledge for code/instruction.
based on instruction, cpsr will check priviledge and decide if operand memories are valid or not.

MPU checks the priviledge level, and then check the memory region of the instruction, and depending on that, it allows, or generates the fault.

-- MPU is for physical memory access validation check,
MPU region table is global. OS and RTOS need to take care of giving illusion of differential access rights of memory by taking
reference of this table. so during context switch, OS needs to reprogram the MPU register. TCB will have copy of MPU register.
for each task there will be TCB and each TCB will have MPU table snapshot. 
-- MMUu is for virtual to  page table management and address translation.
-- ultimately things are coming in physical memory, so that is getting protected by MPU.
-- MMU page table are per each process.
when to use MPU?
-- when everythig is application and no operating system. so no overhead of programming such tables.
-- in multitasking sysytem, these regions can be reprogrammed dynamically, or per task basis or per process basis.
e.g. if task A is an IO task, and taskB is an compuatational task, then we don't want task B to access task A IO memory regions,
and hence table entries will get changed and it will be per task basis. so this is the overhead of using MPU.
-- In OS less system, we have default memory map, which denotes, that everythig is accessible to everything. [flat memory]
-- basic configuration of this map is still required, because, we want to give null pointer referencing issues, stack overflow, memory corruption, invalid access by other process.[loader/linker does NULL to some invalid memory assignment or safe memory pointing.]
-- e.g. SafeRTOS, embedded linux to have bifrucation between OS and application segregation for physical memory.

-- whenever context switch happens, MPU registers are there, these snapshot will get stored in task TCB and next OS while bringing in coming task, will store its previous task's context. MPU, CPU and FPU, all these resigers will be stored during context switch.
To access such registers, priviledge mode is required, and OS has that.
-- task runs in user mode, and it needs OS service so uses system call, switches to priviledge mode and then MPU register read/write and other memory access happnes.

appln or task (unpriviledge) -> system call(unpriviledge) -> svs#number (priviledge).

Designing a bootloader for a microcontroller involves several key steps and considerations. A bootloader is a small program that runs when the microcontroller is powered on or reset, and it is responsible for loading the main application code into the microcontroller's memory. Here’s a high-level overview of the bootloader design process and a contingency plan:

Bootloader Design
1. Define Requirements
Memory Constraints: Determine the size of the bootloader and the available memory.
Communication Protocol: Decide how the bootloader will receive the application code (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C, USB).
Security: Implement security features such as encryption and authentication to prevent unauthorized code loading.
Update Mechanism: Define how the bootloader will handle firmware updates.
2. Initialize Hardware
Configure the necessary hardware peripherals (e.g., clocks, communication interfaces).
Set up the microcontroller’s memory map, including the bootloader and application code regions.
3. Communication Interface
Implement the chosen communication protocol to receive the application code.
Ensure reliable data transfer with error checking mechanisms (e.g., CRC, checksums).
4. Memory Management
Implement functions to erase, write, and verify the application code in the microcontroller’s flash memory.
Ensure that the bootloader does not overwrite itself or critical system areas.
5. Application Code Verification
Verify the integrity and authenticity of the received application code before executing it.
Implement a rollback mechanism in case the new application code is corrupted or fails to execute.
6. Jump to Application Code
Implement a function to jump from the bootloader to the main application code.
Ensure proper initialization of the system before transferring control.
7. Testing and Debugging
Thoroughly test the bootloader under various scenarios to ensure reliability.
Use debugging tools to troubleshoot and optimize the bootloader code.
Example Bootloader Flowchart
Yes
No
Valid
Invalid
Power On/Reset
Initialize Hardware
Check for Update Command
Receive Application Code
Jump to Application Code
Verify Application Code
Write to Flash Memory
Error Handling
Jump to Application Code
Contingency Plan
1. Backup Bootloader
Implement a secondary bootloader or a recovery mode that can be activated if the primary bootloader fails.
Store the backup bootloader in a protected memory region.
2. Watchdog Timer
Use a watchdog timer to reset the microcontroller if the bootloader or application code hangs or crashes.
Ensure the watchdog timer is properly configured and regularly serviced.
3. Fail-Safe Mechanisms
Implement fail-safe mechanisms to detect and recover from errors during the bootloading process.
Use redundant checks and validation steps to ensure data integrity.
4. Logging and Diagnostics
Implement logging mechanisms to record bootloader activities and errors.
Provide diagnostic tools to analyze and troubleshoot bootloader issues.
5. User Notification
Implement mechanisms to notify the user of bootloader status and errors (e.g., LEDs, serial output).
Provide clear instructions for recovery procedures in case of bootloader failure.
6. Regular Updates and Maintenance
Regularly update the bootloader to fix bugs and improve security.
Perform routine maintenance checks to ensure the bootloader is functioning correctly.
By following these design steps and contingency plans, you can create a robust and reliable bootloader for your microcontroller, ensuring smooth and secure firmware updates.

If you need more detailed information or specific code examples, feel free to ask!

learnings:
ask questions before going with any kind of datastructure
if queue then, which kind of queue? priority or regular, or message queue?
no locking used :|

- don't start before understanding
- concepts should be checked and used as you are writing. [i enqueued and didn't bother to talk about shared resource.]
- trade-offs of solution


===================================================================================================================
-- understand problem first,and not down expected outcome. I will set expectations first and then only will proceed.
	-- ask questions like if api takes specific data, if argument can be added to it or not.

-- if data structure has types, ask which particular type should be best for the scenarion.	
-- for data structure make sure you use locking in multithreading environment.

-- when in dilemma talk about tradeoffs of current design and think how to optimize.

// Embedded Firmware
// Fpga programming files are large and contain series of 0’s and 1’s. 
// In a system with limited resources the storage required may be too large.  
// Develop a compression scheme to compress a series of 0’s and 1’s.
//
// Example: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
//
// Assumptions:
//  - Consider each 0 or 1 is represented by a single byte. In the above example; 22 bytes.
//  - Do not worry about allocating the precise amount of memory.
// 
// Write a C++ function that takes the byte vector and outputs a new byte vector representing the compressed version.

Hi Myself, Rajkumar Patel. I hold 7+ years of firmware and embedded software development activity throught my career. 
Media storage, Cloud storage, Network storage and IoT are some of the areas I have worked in.
Which also includes writing baremetal firmware, RTOS based application and building SDK and hands-on with complete product development lifecycle, with Agile methodologies.
My main programming language has been C and for close to one year also used python.
CPP is something I have been using for developing tests for our software products for a long period.
I am seeing my learning in embedded systems domain, working on and implementing core domain of linux kernel and would like to get hang of device driver development in coming years.
