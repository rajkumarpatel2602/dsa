### Recursion practice code will reside here.
### Notes
- Recursion supports 2 phases. ascending and descending. Loops only has ascending phase.
- Ascending will get called before recursive call and descending will be called after recursive function call.
- Recurrence relation is used to calculate the time taken by a recursive function call. this relation can be solved by induction or by successive substitution method.
- Time complexity can also be checked by number of funcation calls made by drawing a tracing tree.
- Don't show copy of a static or global variable in the tracing tree, instead keep the single copy of the same on top.
